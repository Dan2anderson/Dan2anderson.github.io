    <main>
        <h2>Thank you for choosing Encrypted Notes</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe and secure user experience. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Android app.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal or identifying information about you when you use Encrypted Notes. We respect your privacy and are committed to safeguarding your data.</p>

        <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
        <p>Our app uses the following permission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>USE_BIOMETRIC</strong>: This permission allows the app to authenticate the user via biometric data (such as fingerprint or facial recognition). However, we do not collect or store any biometric data. This information is processed and stored solely by your device and is not shared with us or any third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use the Permission</h2>
        <p>The USE_BIOMETRIC permission is used exclusively to ensure that only the authorized user of the device (the phone owner) can access the app. This is for security and privacy purposes, and it does not involve the collection or transmission of any personal or biometric data to our servers.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not share any of your personal information, biometric data, or other information with third parties. No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted by us.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of your information. We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>

        <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there are no personal data rights (such as access, rectification, or deletion) associated with the use of our app.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by other means. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
